## Switch DMM Custom Device ##

**Switch DMM Custom Device** is an add-on developed to handle the coordination between a switch and DMM for taking precision measurements on a number of input channels.

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2011

### Built Availability ###

No publicly built version is available. Contact an NI partner or systems engineering for this service.

### Quality, Limitations ###

This IP was used successfully in a single project to perform a DMM sweep across a specific set of inputs.  This code follows custom device best practices, but further integration will be needed to adapt this to any other use-cases.  It is intended as a reference example of interfacing a Switch and DMM within a custom device, and as a starting point for any such development.
